# Mage ðŸ”®

Mage is designed to allow for the organisation of documents, chiefly images, through tags and document series, and for the quick retrieval of documents based on these tags and series.

## Views

Sans a GUI, document manipulation and viewing is achieved through 'views': folders containing hard links to the internal document files. Views can represent query results, a working space, the currently open files, etc.

## Taxonyms

Taxonyms generalise the notion of names and namespaces with respect to tags. Taxonyms form a tree, and each taxonym has one canonical alias, its true name, and several optional non-canonical aliases. Additionally, taxonyms can have non-canonical parents to further simplify notation. Every tag has a corresponding taxonym, making that taxonym a 'tag name', but not every taxonym has a corresponding tag; those which do not are 'tag namespaces'.

## References

A reference denotes an object like a document, tag, or view, but does not itself communicate the type of the object. There are four kinds of references:

- ID references; e.g. `/786`.
- Name references; e.g. view names, document hashes, tag names.
- Bound references, written with the `.` operator.
- View index references, which refer to a document in a view; e.g. `main/0`, `./6`.

## Working example

```bash

mage init # create an archive in the current directory
mage ingest # ingest files in .mage/in/
mage view in # list documents in the 'in' view: recently ingested documents
mage doc in/0 # see information about first document in the 'in' view
mage view . reflect in # reflect recently ingested documents in main view.
mage view in clear # clear 'in' view

```

## Future example

```bash

mage new taxonym --top-level general # create general namespace
mage new taxonym general character --alias char # create character namespace
mage new tag char vriska_serket --alias vriska # create vriska tag
mage doc ./0 tags add vriska # add vriska tag to document

```
